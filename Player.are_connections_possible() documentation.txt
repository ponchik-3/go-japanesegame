Say we have some dots on the board and we need only one to connect them all
And say the player put the dot right there
in .put_dot method we call .are_connections_possible method
it iterates through all dots that are accessible from given
by accessible I mean that they are or can possibly be connected
then it stores all this construction in one array(wave)
and calls Dot.connections_possibility method
which does all the job
